The main division is between those who want to understand probabilities _objectively_ and those who want to understand probabilities _subjectively_.\n", "\n", "### Historical Relevance\n", "In the early twentieth century, the quantum theory being developed by physicists was saying that the location (etc.) of a particle could be represented by a probabilistic wave function that gave probabilities for the particle to be in one place rather than another. And this question of how to understand these probabilities reared its head. Albert Einstein argued that they could only be interpreted subjectively, but the dominant interpretation today is that there is a kind of indeterminacy in the universe itself.\n", "\n", "### Objective Probability\n", "The paradigmatic theory of _objective_ probability is frequentism, which says that probabilities are a measure of the long-run behvior of physical systems. To say that a die has a 1/6 chance of coming up \"6\" when tossed, for example, is to say that, in the long run as the number of tosses increases without bound, the number of \"6\"s rolled will constitute one sixth of all tosses.\n", "\n", "On this point of view, **we cannot speak meaningfully of the probability of a single event**. Once a die has been rolled, there is no non-trivial probability of its having come up \"6\" or not. Either it did (in which case the probability is 1) or it did not (in which case the probability is 0).\n", "\n", "Similarly, **we cannot speak meaningfully of the probability of a parameter having a certain value, or of a hypothesis being true**. The frequentist will reject the idea of a (meaningful) probability of a die being unfairly weighted. Either it is or it is not.\n", "\n", "\n", "### Subjective Probability\n", "The paradigmatic theory of _subjective_ probability is Bayesianism, which says that probabilities are better understood as rational _degrees of belief_. The standard of rationality is necessary here to assure that these degrees of belief will conform to the probability calculus.\n", "\n", "If probabilities are degrees of belief, then it _does_ make sense to apply them to parameters or to hypotheses. The probability of a die being unfairly weighted would simply represent what it would be rational to believe about the die with respect to its being weighted or not.\n", "\n", "Now: Crucially, what it is rational to believe about the die with respect to its being weighted or not _is a function of what we know about the die!_\n", "\n", "In particular, if we gain the evidence (or knowledge) that the die has been rolled 100 times and come up \"5\" 90 times, then this would have (or, rather, *ought, rationally, to have*) a significant impact on our degree of belief with respect to the weightedness of the die.
